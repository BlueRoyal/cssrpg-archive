# CSS:RPG

CSS:RPG was a game plugin for Counter-Strike: Source, which modified the game to have an RPG-aspect to it. It was fairly
popular during its time, reaching 700+ active servers running the plugin and thousands of players wasting hours trying
to rack up XP and levels on these servers. One of my favorite moments was to find this plugin featured in an issue of
[PC Gamer Magazine](http://jameskoshigoe.com/stuff/cssrpg-pcgamer.jpg) (back when people still purchased magazines).
Something of a confidence-booster for the angsty high-school kid I was when I made this plugin. It was my first foray
into C++, which you can tell I understood nothing about, writing most of the code in a style more reminiscent of C.

This was originally hosted on Sourceforge, which unfortunately, appears to be all but dead. I am keeping it on Github
just for giggles. The code also includes HL2 SDK, which has some modified header files to hack into off-limit internals.
This version of the SDK was needed to build CSS:RPG against. This code is *ancient*, so don't expect to find anything
profound here.
